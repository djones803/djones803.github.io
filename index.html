  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p> My name is D'yante Jones and I am working towards a Fine Arts and Computer Science Degree.
  my skillset includes the use of drawing/painting as well as some visual art designing.
  I also learned how to code in Java and Python; currently I'm learning pieces of JavaScript and HTML.
  I hope to one day become a very skillful coder and combine my talents of art with coding.</p>
